# Conway's Game of Life

This project uses the Java framework 'Processing'. 

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Life)

Your can bring dead cells to life and vice versa with the left mouse button.
With 's' you start/stop the generation iterations, 'r' resets the application.
With 'c' you can switch the camera between 2D and 3D.

Start the application using Processing (Download: https://processing.org/download/).
